### Here you can find the summarized design process in creating a four cylinder engine. This engine was designed in four parts: the piston, the connecting rod, the crankshaft, and the engine assembly.

<p align="center"> <!-- Piston -->

### The first stage concentrated on designing the piston, the heart of internal combustion in the engine. This component serves as the powerhouse, driving the engine through its carefully coordinated four-stroke combustion cycle.

<p align="center"> <!-- Connecting Rod -->

### The second stage involved the designing of the connecting rod. The connecting rod transfers the combustion energy from the piston to the crankshaft.

### The third stage saw the designing of the crankshaft. This is the backbone of the engine. It takes the energy from the connecting rods and converts the linear motion into rotational motion.

### The final stage completed the design of the engine. Each of the individual parts were assembled together to demonstrate their placements and collaborative functionality.
